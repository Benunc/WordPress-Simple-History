title: Progress status&#58; 11 loggers available
---

The development of version2 is moving forward. This week I started to get widget logging going. That means I'm up to 11 loggers, logging events for the following things in WordPress:

* _Plugins_  
installs, updates, activations, deactivations, deletions

* _Themes_  
installs, updates, switching theme, theme customization (using the WordPress customizer)

* _WordPress core_  
updates â€“ manual and background updates

* _Posts, pages, and custom post types_  
creation, edits, status changes, deletions

* __Attachments__  
adding/uploading (including a nice thumbnail!), editing, deleting

* __WordPress settings screens__  
changing options in General, Writing, Reading, Discussion

* __Permalink changes__

* __Comments__ 

* __Exports__ 

* __Menu changes__

* __Users__
