The development of version2 is moving forward. This week I started to get widget logging going. That means I'm up to 11 loggers, logging events for the following things in WordPress:

* _Plugins_  
installs, updates, activations, deactivations, deletions

* _Themes_  
installs, updates, switching themes, customize theme (using the WordPress customizer)

* _WordPress core_  
manual updates and background updates

* _Posts, pages, and custom post types_  
creation, edits, status changes, deletions

* _Attachments_  
adding/uploading (including a nice thumbnail!), editing, deleting

* _WordPress settings screens_  
changing options in the General, Writing, Reading and Discussion options pages

* _Permalink changes_  
changes of permalink and category and tag base structure

* _Comments_  
Info about new comments, changing status

* _Exports_   
Info about what was exported

* _Menus_  
creations, edits, removals

* _Users_  
creations, edits, removals
