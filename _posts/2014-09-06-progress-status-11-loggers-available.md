title: Progress status&#58; 11 loggers available
---

The progress of version 2 is moving forward. This week I started to get widget logging going. That means I'm up to 11 loggers, logging events for the following things in Wordpress:

* Plugins – installs, updates, activations, deactivations, deletions
* Themes - installs, updates, switching theme, theme customization (using the WordPress customizer)
* WordPress core updates – manual and background updates
* Posts, pages, and custom post types – creation, edits, status changes, deletions
* Attachments – adding/uploading (including a nice thumbnail!), editing, deleting
* Wordpress settings screens – changing options in General, Writing, Reading, Discussion
* Permalink changes
* Comments 
* exports 
* menu changes
* user changes
