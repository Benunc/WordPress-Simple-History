status progress

The progress of version 2 is slowly moving forward. This week i started to get widget logging going.

That means I'm up to 11 loggers, logging events for the following things in Wordpress:

* Plugins (installs, updates, activate, deactivate, delete)
* Themes - install, update, switch, customisation 
* Wordpress core updates
* Posts, pages, and custom post types creation, edit, status change, delete
* attachments, adding including a nice thumbnail, editing, deleting
* Wordpress settings screens
* Permalink changes
* comments 
* exports 
* menu changes
* user changes
*
