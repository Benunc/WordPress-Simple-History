Make sure you log your thing and only your thing.

Don't sound like a robot. Humans read the activity feed, so write for them.

Store context.
Store non-translated strings and data, and translate them when viewing the log.
Store message with enough info to make it clear what the message is about, but don't.

Remember that plain text can be used for CSV-export and similar, so text must work without links too. Links are enhancement.
